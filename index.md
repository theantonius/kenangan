## Kenang Kenangan

Kenang Kenangan is a series of digital memories of Indonesia. The artist, Antonius Oki Wiriadjaja, was an American Fulbright Scholar teaching new media at the Institute of Arts, Indonesia in Surakarta (Solo), Central Java. He received a grant to return and do research, but the date his research visa was approved, New York City went into lockdown. The word "kenang" can mean memory, to reminisce, or souvenir depending on context. This collection is an exploration of all three.
